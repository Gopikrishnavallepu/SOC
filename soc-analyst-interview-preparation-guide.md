## SOC Analyst Interview Scenarios

### Scenario 9: Brute Force Attack Detection

**Possible Question:** "Our SIEM has triggered an alert showing multiple failed login attempts to a VPN server. How would you handle this?"

**Strong Response:**
"I would approach this methodically:

1. First, I'd verify if the alert is accurate by examining the raw logs to confirm the failed login pattern
2. I'd analyze the pattern of attempts - timing, username variety, source IPs - to determine if it's automated or manual
3. Check if any attempts were eventually successful, which would escalate the severity significantly
4. Determine if the targeted account(s) are high-privilege, which would also increase the risk
5. Cross-reference source IPs with threat intelligence to identify known malicious actors
6. Review historical data to see if this is part of an ongoing campaign

For response actions, I would:
1. Temporarily block the source IPs if still active
2. Implement additional authentication protection for targeted accounts
3. Review successful logins during the same timeframe for potential compromise
4. Document the incident including all indicators
5. Consider implementing additional controls like rate limiting or geo-blocking if appropriate"

### Scenario 10: Data Exfiltration Detection

**Possible Question:** "A DLP alert shows a large volume of data being uploaded to a cloud storage service. How would you investigate this?"

**Strong Response:**
"To investigate potential data exfiltration to cloud storage:

1. I'd first identify which user account and device initiated the transfer
2. Determine what data was involved and its sensitivity classification
3. Check if the cloud service is authorized within our environment
4. Review the user's normal behavior pattern to identify anomalies
5. Examine proxy/firewall logs to see complete upload history
6. Look for other suspicious activities from the same user/device
7. Check for signs of account compromise or unauthorized access

Based on findings, I would:
1. Contain by temporarily restricting the user's access if warranted
2. Work with the cloud team to potentially recover or delete exfiltrated data
3. Interview the user to determine if this was business-justified or policy violation
4. Document chain of custody if this might involve sensitive data requiring reporting
5. Recommend DLP policy adjustments to prevent similar incidents"

### Scenario 11: Suspicious Process Creation

**Possible Question:** "An EDR alert shows 'cmd.exe' spawning from Microsoft Word. What would be your approach to investigating this?"

**Strong Response:**
"This alert suggests potential exploitation of Microsoft Word, as it's unusual for Word to spawn command prompt. My investigation would proceed as follows:

1. Examine the complete process tree to understand the command line parameters passed to cmd.exe
2. Identify what commands were executed through the command prompt
3. Determine the document that triggered this behavior and isolate it for analysis
4. Check for network connections established around the time of execution
5. Look for persistence mechanisms or additional payloads that may have been deployed
6. Review the user's recent email attachments or downloads as potential infection vectors

I would then:
1. Isolate the affected endpoint if active malicious behavior is confirmed
2. Scan the suspicious document in a sandbox environment
3. Search for similar activity across the environment
4. Implement blocking rules for identified IOCs
5. Collect memory and disk forensic evidence before remediation if this appears to be a significant compromise"

### Scenario 12: Network Reconnaissance Detection

**Possible Question:** "Your network IDS has detected port scanning activity from an internal IP address. How would you handle this alert?"

**Strong Response:**
"Internal port scanning could indicate lateral movement attempts or a compromised device. I would:

1. Identify the device associated with the scanning IP address and its owner
2. Determine the scope of scanning - targeted systems, ports, and protocols
3. Check if this device is authorized to perform scanning (e.g., vulnerability scanner)
4. Review authentication logs for the scanning device to identify the user context
5. Examine the scanning device for signs of compromise
6. Look for connections to suspicious external domains prior to the scanning activity
7. Check targeted systems for successful exploitation or unauthorized access

Response actions would include:
1. Isolating the scanning device if unauthorized and suspicious
2. Blocking the scanning activity at the network level
3. Analyzing targeted systems for successful compromise
4. Escalating to incident response if evidence suggests malicious activity
5. Documenting findings for potential policy violations if this was unauthorized but benign activity"

### Scenario 13: Ransomware Detection

**Possible Question:** "Your file integrity monitoring system has detected mass file modifications with encryption signatures. What steps would you take?"

**Strong Response:**
"This alert pattern strongly suggests ransomware activity. I would immediately:

1. Identify the affected system(s) and isolate them from the network to prevent lateral spread
2. Determine the user account context under which the encryption is happening
3. Check for ransom notes or known ransomware extensions on the files
4. Review process execution history to identify the ransomware binary
5. Look for the initial infection vector through recent activities (email attachments, downloads, etc.)
6. Scan the environment for indicators of the same ransomware on other systems
7. Check backup systems to ensure they haven't been compromised

For response actions:
1. Initiate formal incident response procedures including stakeholder notification
2. Disable potentially compromised accounts
3. Block any identified command and control servers at the firewall/proxy
4. Prepare for potential restoration from backups
5. Preserve forensic evidence for investigation and potential law enforcement reporting
6. Begin impact assessment for affected data and systems"

### Scenario 14: Suspicious Domain Communication

**Possible Question:** "An alert shows a workstation communicating with a newly registered domain using an unusual port. How would you investigate this?"

**Strong Response:**
"Communication with newly registered domains on non-standard ports is concerning as it may indicate C2 traffic. My investigation would include:

1. Analyze the full network traffic pattern - frequency, data volume, and protocol details
2. Research the domain for reputation, WHOIS information, and hosting details
3. Check for domain generation algorithm (DGA) patterns suggesting malware
4. Identify which process on the workstation is initiating the communication
5. Review the user's recent activities that might have led to infection
6. Check for similar traffic patterns from other hosts in the environment
7. Examine DNS logs for resolution patterns of similar suspicious domains

Response actions:
1. Block the suspicious domain at DNS and network levels
2. Isolate the affected workstation for further investigation
3. Capture memory and disk images if sophisticated threat is suspected
4. Look for additional IOCs on the system
5. Determine if data exfiltration occurred based on traffic volume and patterns
6. Document findings for potential threat hunting across the environment"

### Scenario 15: Insider Threat Investigation

**Possible Question:** "A DLP alert indicates a user has accessed an unusually high number of sensitive documents in a short period. How would you approach this investigation?"

**Strong Response:**
"This alert requires careful investigation as it could indicate either an insider threat or a compromised account. I would:

1. Review the user's role and normal access patterns to establish a baseline
2. Check the timing of access (during/outside business hours) and location
3. Examine which specific documents were accessed and if they share a pattern
4. Look for evidence of exfiltration such as downloads, prints, or emails
5. Review authentication logs for unusual login patterns or locations
6. Check for recent changes to the user's role or project assignments
7. Correlate with HR information about the employee's status (new project, resignation notice, etc.)

For response actions:
1. Maintain confidentiality of the investigation as this may involve sensitive HR issues
2. Document all evidence with careful attention to chain of custody
3. Consider implementing additional monitoring on the user's activities
4. Consult with legal and HR teams before taking containment actions
5. If account compromise is suspected rather than insider threat, implement immediate account security measures
6. Present findings objectively with supporting evidence to appropriate stakeholders"

## Common Technical Questions

### Windows Security Questions

1. **Question:** "What Windows Event IDs would you monitor for detecting privilege escalation attempts?"
   **Answer:** "Key Event IDs include 4624 (successful logon), 4672 (special privileges assigned), 4720 (account creation), 4732 (user added to security-enabled local group), and 4738 (user account changes). I would also monitor 4688 (process creation) with command line logging enabled to detect suspicious privilege escalation techniques."

2. **Question:** "How would you detect a Pass-the-Hash attack in Windows environments?"
   **Answer:** "I would look for Event ID 4624 with logon type 3 and NTLM authentication where a single account is logging into multiple systems in a short timeframe. Additionally, monitoring for Event ID 4625 (failed logon) with status 0xC000015B can indicate password hash use. Tools like Microsoft ATA and EDR solutions can also specifically detect PtH techniques by analyzing authentication patterns."

3. **Question:** "What's the significance of PowerShell Event ID 4104?"
   **Answer:** "Event ID 4104 captures PowerShell script block logging, which records the content of PowerShell commands executed on the system. This is crucial for detecting malicious PowerShell usage including obfuscated commands, encoded scripts, and fileless malware execution. It provides visibility into the actual code being executed rather than just the PowerShell process launch."

### Network Security Questions

1. **Question:** "Explain the difference between IDS and IPS systems."
   **Answer:** "Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) monitor network traffic to identify suspicious patterns and generate alerts, but don't actively block traffic - they operate in passive monitoring mode. Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) incorporate all IDS capabilities but can also take active blocking measures when threats are detected. IPS generally sits inline with traffic flow allowing it to drop malicious packets, while IDS typically receives traffic via port mirroring or network TAP."

2. **Question:** "How would you identify a DNS tunneling attack?"
   **Answer:** "DNS tunneling can be identified by looking for several indicators: unusually large DNS queries and responses, high volumes of DNS traffic to a single domain, DNS requests containing encoded data or high entropy strings in subdomains, abnormal request timing (e.g., regular intervals suggesting C2 beaconing), and DNS traffic to newly registered or suspicious domains. Tools like Zeek/Bro can be used to analyze DNS traffic patterns and detect these anomalies."

3. **Question:** "What information can you gather from NetFlow data during an investigation?"
   **Answer:** "NetFlow data provides valuable metadata about network connections including source/destination IP addresses, ports, protocols, bytes/packets transferred, and timestamps. During an investigation, this helps identify communication patterns, potential data exfiltration based on asymmetric traffic flows, beaconing to C2 servers, lateral movement between internal systems, and scanning activities. While it doesn't contain packet content, the connection metadata can reveal suspicious communication patterns."

### SIEM and Log Analysis Questions

1. **Question:** "What are some ways to reduce false positives in SIEM alerts?"
   **Answer:** "To reduce false positives in SIEM environments, I would: implement proper baselining of normal behavior, use multi-condition correlation rules rather than single-condition triggers, incorporate context from threat intelligence, tune detection thresholds based on environment specifics, implement whitelisting for known good behavior, use machine learning for anomaly detection when available, and conduct regular rule reviews to eliminate consistently noisy alerts. Most importantly, I'd document all tuning decisions and validate that critical detection capabilities aren't compromised."

2. **Question:** "How would you build a correlation rule to detect lateral movement?"
   **Answer:** "I would create a correlation rule that looks for a sequence of related events across different data sources. This would include: successful authentication from a workstation to a server followed by first-time administrative tool usage, multiple authentication events from the same source to different destinations in a short timeframe, use of account credentials on systems they don't typically access, execution of discovery commands followed by connection attempts, and SMB/RDP/WinRM connections between endpoints that don't typically communicate."

3. **Question:** "What key log sources would you prioritize in a new SIEM implementation?"
   **Answer:** "For a new SIEM implementation, I would prioritize: Windows Security Event logs (especially authentication, account management, and process creation), firewall logs for network boundary visibility, VPN and remote access logs to monitor external entry points, DNS logs for detecting malicious domain communications, proxy logs for web-based threat visibility, authentication systems (Active Directory, LDAP, IAM), and endpoint detection logs. This combination provides visibility across the attack surface while focusing on high-value security events."

## Log Analysis Practice

### Windows Event Log Analysis

**Sample Log:**
```
Log Name:      Security
Source:        Microsoft Windows security
Event ID:      4688
Task Category: Process Creation
Level:         Information
Keywords:      Audit Success
User:          N/A
Computer:      WORKSTATION01
Description:
A new process has been created.
Creator Subject:
 Security ID:  DOMAIN\user
 Account Name:  user
 Account Domain:  DOMAIN
 Logon ID:  0x1234567

Process Information:
 New Process ID:  0x1404
 New Process Name: C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe
 Token Elevation Type: %%1936
 Mandatory Label:  Mandatory Label\High Mandatory Level
 Creator Process ID: 0x2195
 Creator Process Name: C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\root\Office16\WINWORD.EXE
 Process Command Line: cmd.exe /c powershell.exe -nop -w hidden -enc JQBlAG4AYwA9...
```

**Analysis Approach:**
"This log shows Process Creation (Event ID 4688) where Microsoft Word (WINWORD.EXE) spawned a command prompt (cmd.exe), which then launched PowerShell with suspicious parameters. The red flags include:
1. Office application spawning command shell (unusual parent-child relationship)
2. Use of PowerShell with '-nop' (no profile), '-w hidden' (hidden window), and '-enc' (encoded command)
3. This pattern is consistent with malicious document exploitation for initial access

I would immediately investigate this as a potential phishing-based compromise, isolate the affected system, and determine what the encoded PowerShell command was attempting to do."

### Firewall Log Analysis

**Sample Log:**
```
date=2023-08-15 time=14:22:35 devname=Firewall01 devid=FG100D0000000 logid=0000000013 type=traffic subtype=forward level=notice vd=root srcip=10.1.1.45 srcport=49732 srcintf="internal" dstip=185.212.47.29 dstport=443 dstintf="wan1" sessionid=15473025 proto=6 action=deny policyid=27 dstcountry="Netherlands" srccountry="Reserved" trandisp=noop service=HTTPS duration=0 sentbyte=0 rcvdbyte=0 sentpkt=0 rcvdpkt=0 appcat="unscanned"
```

**Analysis Approach:**
"This firewall log shows a blocked outbound connection attempt from an internal IP (10.1.1.45) to an external IP (185.212.47.29) in the Netherlands over HTTPS (port 443). Key observations:
1. The connection was denied based on policy ID 27
2. No data was transferred (sentbyte=0, rcvdbyte=0)
3. The destination IP should be checked against threat intelligence sources
4. I would investigate the internal source IP for potential compromise or policy violation
5. I would check for other connection attempts from the same internal IP to identify patterns

This could represent attempted command and control communications or data exfiltration attempts that were successfully blocked by the firewall."

### Web Proxy Log Analysis

**Sample Log:**
```
1566842430.045 1337 10.0.0.12 TCP_MISS/200 420 GET http://malicious-domain.com/config.bin - DIRECT/103.45.67.89 application/octet-stream
1566842445.799 956 10.0.0.12 TCP_MISS/200 8286 POST https://legitimate-cloud.com/api/upload - DIRECT/34.218.56.123 application/json
1566842512.418 89 10.0.0.12 TCP_MISS/200 24568 GET http://malicious-domain.com/update.exe - DIRECT/103.45.67.89 application/x-msdownload
```

**Analysis Approach:**
"These proxy logs show suspicious web activity from the same internal IP (10.0.0.12):
1. The user accessed a suspicious domain ('malicious-domain.com') twice
2. First download was a binary file ('config.bin'), potentially a configuration for malware
3. Then an HTTP POST to a legitimate cloud service API occurred, suggesting possible data exfiltration
4. Finally, an executable was downloaded ('update.exe') from the suspicious domain

This sequence strongly suggests compromise: malware configuration download, followed by data exfiltration to cloud storage, then malware update. I would immediately isolate this host, begin endpoint investigation, and block the malicious domain at the proxy and DNS levels."
